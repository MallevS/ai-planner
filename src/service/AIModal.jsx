The Deuce bus is an affordable option for longer distances. Avoid taxis and ride-sharing services as much as possible.\n*   **Food:**  Look for affordable restaurants off the main Strip.  Fast food, food courts, and grocery stores are your allies.  Consider bringing snacks.\n*   **Drinks:**  Las Vegas drinks can be expensive. Drink water to stay hydrated and avoid buying alcohol frequently.\n*   **Gambling:** It's easy to get caught up in the casinos, but stick to your budget and avoid gambling if you're trying to save money.\n*   **Free Activities:**  Las Vegas has tons of free things to do. Take advantage of them!\n*   **Hotel Location:** Hotels a bit off the Strip are often cheaper.  Consider the Stratosphere or hotels downtown.\n*   **Travel Time:**  Factor in travel time, especially when going downtown.\n\nThis itinerary is a starting point.  Adjust it to your interests and energy levels. Have a fantastic time in Las Vegas!\n" },
